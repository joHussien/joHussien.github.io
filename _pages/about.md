### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Youssef Hussein  
I‚Äôm a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), advised by [Prof. Mohamed Mokbel](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/mohamed-mokbel) at the **Data Management Lab**.  
My research focuses on **spatial data systems**, **large-scale data management**, and the **intersection of databases and AI**, especially **LLM evaluation for spatial data applications**. I have publications in top-tier venues as VLDB, SIGSPATIAL, and MDM, please refer to my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_aZutVoAAAAJ&hl=en) the full list of publications.

### üéì Academic Background  
Before joining UMN, I earned my **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** from the [American University in Cairo (AUC)](https://www.aucegypt.edu/) in 2023, with minors in Mathematics and Arabic Studies.  
My undergraduate thesis, *["GPU Accelerated Dataflow Analysis"](https://www.academia.edu/102804649/GPU_Accelerated_Dataflow_Analysis)*, proposed a GPU-based matrix formulation to enhance dataflow analysis performance.
