I am a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Database Management Lab @University of Minnesota. I graduated 2023 from the American University in Cairo with Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering and double minor in Maths and Arabic Studies. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). 

I'm currently a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](http://www.msra.cn/), in a group managed by [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). Before joining MSRA, I obtained my Ph.D. from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in June, 2019. My doctoral thesis was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2018/04--2018/08, I was a visitor of Prof. [Qiang Yang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/)'s group at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My work on transfer learning won the best paper awards in ICCSE 2018 and FTL-IJCAI 2019. In 2021, I published the textbook [Introduction to Transfer Learning](http://jd92.wang/tlbook), a hands-on introduction to transfer learning. In 2022, I was selected as one of the [2022 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner between 2012-2021 (ranked 49/2000). Four of my first-author papers are ranked by Google Scholar as [highly-cited papers](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/421192644). I gave tutorials at [IJCAI'22](https://dgresearch.github.io/), WSDM 2023, and KDD 2023.

**Research interest:** robust machine learning, out-of-distribution / domain generalization, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications such as activity recognition and computer vision. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and [robustness enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/). See this [page](https://jd92.wang/research/) for more details. *Interested in [internship](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/102558267) or collaboration? Contact me.*

**Announcement:** I'm experimenting a new form of research collaboration. You can click [here](https://forms.office.com/r/32Fs6uAjT6) if you are interested!
