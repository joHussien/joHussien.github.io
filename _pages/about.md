I'm currently a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Database Management Lab at [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), supervised by [Prof. Mohamed Mokbel](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/mohamed-mokbel). I graduated in 2023 from the [American University in Cairo (AUC)](https://www.aucegypt.edu/) with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering and double minor in Maths and Arabic Studies. My Thesis titled ["GPU Accelrated Dataflow analysis"](https://www.academia.edu/102804649/GPU_Accelerated_Dataflow_Analysis) was supervised by [Dr. Karim Aly](https://karimali.ca/) and [Dr. Cherif Salama](aucegypt.edu/fac/cherif-salama-salama). In this project, we accelerated dataflow analysis by proposing a GPU-compatible implementation based on matrix representation, achieving up to 250% speedup compared to CPU implementations, providing a more efficient solution for real-time development environments and enhancing bug detection in software development.

During my time at AUC, I worked as a Junior Research Assistant at the [Computer Science Department](https://sse.aucegypt.edu/departments/cse) under the supervision of [Dr. Nouri Sakr](https://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/nouri). In this research project we approached a dual-criticality scheduling problem in an online/offline context by various Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. Additionally, I was a Research Engineer in the [Construction Engineering Department](https://sse.aucegypt.edu/departments/construction-engineering) at AUC, where I led the development of an embedded application for a multidisciplinary research project, proposing a multi-objective optimization model for sustainable farming while minimizing water consumption, and utilizing Python libraries like Beautiful Soup and Pandas to scrape real-time data for the app database using Excel VBA.

With a diverse industrial background, I have contributed to various roles, including working as a Platforms Software Engineer Intern at [Dell Technologies](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/about-us/who-we-are.htm), where I contributed to multiple modules in the [5G team](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/what-we-do/emerging-technology/5g.htm#tab0=0) using C++. I conducted unit testing with GoogleTest, worked with containers using Docker & Podman, and deployed continuous code changes using GitHub in an Agile working framework. Following my experience at Dell Technologies, I served as a Computer Fundamentals Nanodegree Session Lead at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/about-us), supervising and mentoring a cohort of 200 students aged 12-17 for 15 hours per week over a span of 6 months. I guided them through the program's concepts, including HTTP, TCP/IP, HTML, CLIs, algorithmic problem-solving, and data encoding, as part of the [Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative](https://deci.gov.eg/), achieving an impressive graduation rate of 97%. Additionally, during my internship at Silicon Arena LLC, I collaborated as a Front-End Engineer Intern within an Agile framework, developing multiple components using React.js for an open-source eCommerce [website](https://github.com/SiliconArena/alphamart) based on documented software requirements specifications (SRS).


**Research interest:** Spatial data, data management systems, and machine learning. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and spatial data. 

**Announcement:** This is a new website, it's still under construction. You might find some erros :)
