I'm currently a 1st year Ph.D. student at the Database Management Lab at [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), supervised by [Prof. Mohamed Mokbel](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/mohamed-mokbel). I graduated in 2023 from the American University in Cairo with Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering and double minor in Maths and Arabic Studies. 


**Research interest:** Spatial data, data management systems, and machine learning. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and spatial data. 

**Announcement:** This is a new website, it's still under construction. You might find some erros :)
