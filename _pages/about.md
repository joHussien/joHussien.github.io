I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the Database Management Lab at the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), under the supervision of [Prof. Mohamed Mokbel](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/mohamed-mokbel). I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering at the [American University in Cairo (AUC)](https://www.aucegypt.edu/) in 2023, with double minors in Mathematics and Arabic Studies.

My Thesis ["GPU Accelrated Dataflow analysis"](https://www.academia.edu/102804649/GPU_Accelerated_Dataflow_Analysis) revolved around GPU-accelerated dataflow analysis. This project, supervised by [Dr. Karim Aly](https://karimali.ca/) and [Dr. Cherif Salama](aucegypt.edu/fac/cherif-salama-salama), proposed a GPU-compatible implementation based on matrix representation. Our work achieved remarkable speedup of up to 250% compared to CPU implementations, offering a more efficient solution for real-time development environments and enhancing bug detection in software development.

During my time at AUC, I served as a Junior Research Assistant at the [Computer Science Department](https://sse.aucegypt.edu/departments/cse) under the guidance of [Dr. Nouri Sakr](https://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/nouri). In this position, I contributed to a research project addressing the dual-criticality scheduling problem using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. Additionally, I worked as a Research Engineer in the [Construction Engineering Department](https://sse.aucegypt.edu/departments/construction-engineering) at AUC, where I led the development of an embedded application for a multidisciplinary research project. My responsibilities included proposing a multi-objective optimization model for sustainable farming while minimizing water consumption. I utilized Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Pandas to scrape real-time data for the app database using Excel VBA.

In terms of industry experience, I had the opportunity to work as a Platforms Software Engineer Intern at [Dell Technologies](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/about-us/who-we-are.htm). There, I actively contributed to the [5G team](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/what-we-do/emerging-technology/5g.htm#tab0=0), utilizing C++ to develop multiple modules. I conducted unit testing using GoogleTest, worked with containers using Docker and Podman, and deployed continuous code changes using GitHub, following an Agile working framework. Furthermore, I served as a Computer Fundamentals Nanodegree Session Lead at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/about-us), mentoring and supervising a cohort of 200 students aged 12-17. I guided them through various concepts, including HTTP, TCP/IP, HTML, CLIs, algorithmic problem-solving, and data encoding, as part of the [Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative](https://deci.gov.eg/). We achieved an impressive graduation rate of 97%. Additionally, I interned at Silicon Arena LLC, collaborating as a Front-End Engineer Intern within an Agile framework. I contributed to the development of multiple components using React.js for an open-source eCommerce [website](https://github.com/SiliconArena/alphamart) based on documented software requirements specifications (SRS).

Overall, my academic and industry experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set and a strong foundation in computer science and engineering. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and contributing to innovative research and development projects.


**Research interest:** Spatial data, data management systems, and machine learning. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and spatial data. 

**Announcement:** This is a new website, it's still under construction. You might find some erros :)
