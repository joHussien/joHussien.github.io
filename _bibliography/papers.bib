abstract = {Recently, population growth and resource depletion have been matched by a growing demand for self-sustaining communities. Numerous studies promote sustainable solutions to the concerns of climate change and food scarcity. This study aims at creating an automated Economic Land Utilization Optimization Model (ELUOM) that identifies sustainable and cost-effective agricultural practices. Soil, water &amp; climatic characteristics of over 400 crops are gathered in a relational database to build the model. Evolutionary algorithms are utilized to filter the database based on user input. Optimization process is then performed on all possible utilization plans of the filtered crops to maximize the 20-year return while minimizing water consumption. The model is verified on a case study in Giza, Egypt where it shows the potential of increasing the return/m3 of water by 370% versus current practices. This research also studies the application of ELOUM on a vacant plot in the American university in Cairo, Egypt.},

    abstract = {Real-time embedded systems have stringent non-functional requirements on cost,
weight, and energy that give rise to the study of mixed-criticality (mc) systems, where
functionalities of dierent criticality levels are consolidated into a shared hardware
platform (Barhorst et al. [1], Burns and Davis [6]). The literature discusses the schedulability of mc systems under various conditions and objectives (Baruah et al. [3], Gu
et al. [7], Baruah et al. [4]). In this work, we study a dual-criticality, non-preemptive
system with a varying-speed uniprocessor.
This varying-speed processor makes mc scheduling dynamic: In real-time systems,
it cannot be predetermined if, when or for how long the processor would degrade, i.e.
its speed would drop. Under speed stochasticity, it is critical to guarantee the running
of high (hi) criticality jobs by their deadlines, sometimes even at the cost of not running
low (lo) criticality jobs at all, when operating under degradation.
Scheduling mc systems non-preemptively (even without degradation) is N P-hard
(Lenstra et al. [9]). Baruah and Guo [5] model an LP to preemptively schedule dualcriticality jobs on a varying-speed processor. Agarwal and Baruah [2] further discuss
the online nature of the problem and its intractability. We agree with the authors that
mc scheduling is inherently an online problem, as it better depicts real-time scheduling
and the dynamic nature of this problem. Therefore, we devise deep reinforcement
learning (deep rl or drl) to tackle the problem presented by Baruah and Guo [5],
under both the oine and online setting.},
